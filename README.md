HTML Tags Frequency Analysis
============================

I needed an approximate relative usage of various HTML tags over the internet. After a lot of research  couldn't find any sources that analyzed dataset big enough for the data to be reliable. So, I did it myself!
Works in this directory analyze 3 WARC files which were downloaded from commoncrawl(thanks!)
Each file was ~4GB in size which means that these results were derived by analyzing over 10GB of data!
Now, it also includes usage of different attributes for every tag studied over the same dataset.
